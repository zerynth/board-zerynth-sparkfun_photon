SparkFun Photon RedBoard
========================

The SparkFun Photon RedBoard is a complete Wi-Fi enabled development platform for creating connected devices with ease. The Photon RedBoard has been based around the P1 Particle Module. The I/O, USB, and power connectors are all broken out to a familiar Arduino shape.

The P1 (P-one) is Particle's tiny Wi-Fi module that contains both the Broadcom BCM43362 Wi-Fi chip and a reprogrammable `STM32F205RGY6 32-bit ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller <http://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/datasheet/bc/21/42/43/b0/f3/4d/d3/CD00237391.pdf/files/CD00237391.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00237391.pdf>`_.

In addition to having 1MB of internal flash memory for storing the firmware, the SparkFun Photon also features 128KB of Ram, 1MB of extra SPI flash and 120 MHz of clock.

Flash Layout
************

The internal flash of the SparkFun Photon RedBoard is organized into sectors of different size according to the following table:

=============  =======  =================
Start address  Size      Content
=============  =======  =================
  0x8000000      16Kb   BootLoader
  0x8004000      16Kb   DCT1
  0x8008000      16Kb   DCT2
  0x800C000      16Kb   EEPROM1 
  0x8010000      64Kb   EEPROM2 
  0x8020000     128kb   Virtual Machine
  0x8040000     128kb   Bytecode Bank 0
  0x8060000     128kb   Bytecode Bank 1
  0x8080000     128kb   Bytecode Bank 2
  0x80A0000     128kb   Bytecode Bank 3
  0x80C0000     128kb   Bytecode Bank 4
  0x80E0000     128kb   Bytecode Bank 5
=============  =======  =================

.. important:: To avoid deleting the SparkFun Photon configuration it is recommended not to write in sectors between 0x8004000 and 0x8020000.

.. warning:: If internal flash is used in a Zerynth program, it is recommended to start from pages at the end of flash (bytecode bank 5) towards the virtual machine, to minimize the chance of clashes. Since writing to a sector entails erasing it first, the write operation can be slow even for small chunks of data, depending on the size of the chosen sector.

Power
*****

Power to the SparkFun Photon device is supplied via the on-board USB micro B connector or directly via the VIN pin:
  
  * If power is supplied directly to the VIN pin, the voltage should be regulated between 3.6VDC and 5.5VDC.
  * If the device is powered via the USB port, VIN will output a voltage of approximately 4.8VDC due to a reverse polarity protection series schottky diode between V+ of USB and VIN.

.. note:: When used as an output, the max load current on VIN is 1 Ampere.

Typical current consumption is 80mA with a 5V input. Deep sleep quiescent current is 160uA. When powering the SparkFun Photon from the USB connector, make sure to use a quality cable to minimize voltage drops. If a high resistance cable (i.e., low current) is used, peak currents drawn from the SparkFun Photon when transmitting and receiving will result in voltage sag at the input which may cause a system brown out or intermittent operation. Likewise, the power source should be sufficient enough to source 1A of current to be on the safe side.


Connect, Register, Virtualize and Program
*****************************************

On **Windows** machines (Windows 10), the SparkFun Photon RedBoard in **Standard Mode** is automatically recognized as Virtual Serial port; otherwise `Particle USB Drivers for SparkFun Photon <https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/core/#installing-the-particle-driver>`_ are required by Zerynth Studio for accessing the serial port establishing a connection with the STM32 UART.

To install the drivers on **Windows** plug the SparkFun Photon on an USB port, download the *.exe package, and follow the installation steps to complete the operation.

.. note:: It could be necessary to temporarily disable the digitally signed driver enforcement policy of Windows to allow driver installation. There are good instructions on how to do that in `this guide <http://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/>`_.

On **MAC OSX** and **Linux** platforms USB drivers are not required.

.. note:: **For Linux Platform**: to allow the access to serial ports the user needs read/write access to the serial device file. Adding the user to the group, that owns this file, gives the required read/write access:
            
            * **Ubuntu** distribution --> dialout group
            * **Arch Linux** distribution --> uucp group

         If the device is still not recognized or not working, the following udev rules may need to be added: ::
	
          	#SparkFun Photon    
          	SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2b04", ATTRS{idProduct}=="d008", MODE="0666", GROUP="users", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
          	SUBSYSTEMS=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2b04", ATTRS{idProduct}=="d008", MODE="0666", GROUP="users", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
          	SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2b04", ATTRS{idProduct}=="c008", MODE="0666", GROUP="users", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
          	SUBSYSTEMS=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2b04", ATTRS{idProduct}=="c008", MODE="0666", GROUP="users", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"

Once connected on a USB port, if drivers have been correctly installed, the SparkFun Photon RedBoard can be seen as Virtual Serial port and it is automatically recognized by Zerynth Studio and listed in the **Device Management Toolbar** as "SparkFun Photon RedBoard DFU Mode" if the device is in DFU Mode, otherwise as "SparkFun Photon RedBoard".

To register and virtualize a Photon RedBoard, it is necessary to put the device in DFU Mode (Device Firmware Upgrade).

.. note:: On **Windows** machines it is necessary to install also the SparkFun Photon DFU drivers for virtualizing the device.

            The official **Particle Core** DFU driver and the related installation procedure are reported `here <https://community.particle.io/t/tutorial-installing-dfu-driver-on-windows-24-feb-2015/3518>`_ but they also work for **SparkFun Photon RedBoard**.

Follow these steps to register and virtualize a Photon RedBoard:

* **Put** the SparkFun Photon in **DFU Mode** (Device Firmware Upgrade):

  * Hold down BOTH buttons (reset and mode);
  * Release only the reset button, while holding down the mode button;
  * Wait for the LED to start flashing magenta, then yellow;
  * Release the mode button; the device is now in DFU Mode (yellow blinking led);

* **Select** the SparkFun Photon on the **Device Management Toolbar**;
* **Register** the device by clicking the "Z" button from the Zerynth Studio;
* **Create** the unique Zerynth Virtual Machine for the connected device by clicking the "Z" button for the second time;
* **Virtualize** the device by clicking the "Z" button for the third time.

.. note:: During these operations the SparkFun Photon device must be in **DFU Mode**. if the device returns in standard mode, it is necessary to put it in DFU Mode again

After virtualization, the SparkFun Photon is ready to be programmed and the  Zerynth scripts **uploaded**. Just **Select** the virtualized device from the "Device Management Toolbar" and **click** the dedicated "upload" button of Zerynth Studio and **reset** the device by pressing the Reset on-board button when asked.

.. important:: To exploit the Wi-Fi chip functionalities of the SparkFun Photon, the :ref:`lib.broadcom.bcm43362 library <broadcom_bcm43362>` must be installed and imported on the Zerynth script.
